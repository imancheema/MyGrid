# MyGrid+ : Web App for Battery Storage Optimization

## Overview
MyGRID+ is a battery storage optimization application designed to enhance the efficiency, performance, and cost-effectiveness of utility-scale battery systems. These systems are crucial for storing renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and in improving grid stability and reliability.

## Features
- User Authentication and Profile Management
- Battery Dashboard Monitoring
- Energy Consumption Analysis and Load Management
- Optimization Algorithms

## Battery Simulation
The Valence: U27_12XP lithium-ion battery was chosen for its reliability, high performance, and suitability for renewable energy sources like solar and wind. A MATLAB simulation was developed to analyze the battery's behavior under various conditions and retrieve data used for the battery dashboard on the website.
